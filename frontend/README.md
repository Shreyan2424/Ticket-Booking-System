# Frontend - Ticket Booking System (skeleton)

Tech: React + TypeScript + Vite

Setup:
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run start

This is a minimal skeleton that talks to the backend. It provides:
- / : list shows
- /admin : create shows
- /booking/:id : simple booking page

State management and seat-grid UI are intentionally minimal to keep project compact. Expand as needed.
